# Student Performance Prediction (Math Score)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting students' **Math scores** based on demographic, academic, and lifestyle features. The goal is to analyze the factors influencing student performance and build machine learning models that accurately forecast their outcomes. By leveraging data science techniques, this project provides insights into student success and highlights the importance of data-driven education.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information about students' backgrounds, study habits, and parental influences, which can potentially impact their performance in Math. It includes categorical and numerical features such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, test preparation, and scores.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (for app deployment)  

## 🚀 Approach
1. Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing** to handle missing values and categorical variables.  
2. Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with visualizations to understand feature relationships.  
3. Built multiple ML models including **Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost**.  
4. Applied **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.  
5. Evaluated models using **R² Score, MAE, and RMSE**.  
6. Deployed an interactive **web application with Streamlit** for real-time predictions.  

## 📈 Results
- The best-performing model achieved an **R² Score of 0.98**, demonstrating strong predictive capability.  
- Feature importance analysis highlighted **parental education and test preparation** as key factors.  

## 🌐 Deployment
The project includes a **Streamlit web app** where users can input student details and instantly predict Math scores.
